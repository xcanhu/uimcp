## Introduction

**ScreenCoder** is an intelligent UI-to-code generation system that transforms any screenshot or design mockup into clean, production-ready HTML/CSS code. Built with a modular multi-agent architecture, it combines visual understanding, layout planning, and adaptive code synthesis to produce accurate and editable front-end code.

It also supports customized modifications, allowing developers and designers to tweak layout and styling with ease. Whether you're prototyping quickly or building pixel-perfect interfaces, ScreenCoder bridges the gap between design and development — just copy, customize, and deploy.

## Qualitative Comparisons

We present qualitative examples to illustrate the improvements achieved by our method over existing approaches. The examples below compare the output of a baseline method with ours on the same input.

### Baseline or Other Method

### Our Method

As shown above, our method produces results that are more accurate, visually aligned, and semantically faithful to the original design.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: The main script to generate final HTML code for a single screenshot.
- `UIED/`: Contains the UIED (UI Element Detection) engine for analyzing screenshots and detecting components.
  - `run_single.py`: Python script to run UI component detection on a single image.
- `html_generator.py`: Takes the detected component data and generates a complete HTML layout with generated code for each module.
- `image_replacer.py`: A script to replace placeholder divs in the final HTML with actual cropped images.
- `mapping.py`: Maps the detected UIED components to logical page regions.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the necessary Python dependencies for the project.
- `doubao_api.txt`: API key file for the Doubao model (should be kept private and is included in `.gitignore`).

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/leigest519/ScreenCoder.git
    cd screencoder
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Configure the model and API key**
    - ***Choose a generation model***: Set the desired model in `block_parsor.py` and `html_generator.py`. Supported options: Doubao(default), Qwen, GPT, Gemini.
    - ***Add the API key***: Create a plain-text file (`doubao_api.txt`, `qwen_api.txt`, `gpt_api.txt`, `gemini_api.txt`) in the project root directory that corresponds to your selected model, and paste your API key inside.

## Usage

The typical workflow is a multi-step process as follows:

1.  **Initial Generation with Placeholders:**
    Run the Python script to generate the initial HTML code for a given screenshot.
    - Block Detection:
      ```bash
      python block_parsor.py
      ```
    - Generation with Placeholders (Gray Images Blocks):
      ```bash
      python html_generator.py
      ```

2.  **Final HTML Code:**
    Run the python script to generate final HTML code with copped images from the original screenshot.
    - Placeholder Detection:
      ```bash
      python image_box_detection.py
      ```
    - UI Element Detection:
      ```bash
      python UIED/run_single.py
      ```
    - Mapping Alignment Between Placeholders and UI Elements:
      ```bash
      python mapping.py
      ```
    - Placeholder Replacement:
      ```bash
      python image_replacer.py
      ```

3.  **Simple Run:**
    Run the python script to generate the final HTML code:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
